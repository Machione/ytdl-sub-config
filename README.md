# ytdl-sub-config

Configuration for [ytdl-sub](https://github.com/jmbannon/ytdl-sub) to download YouTube subscriptions to [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org).

## Installation

I [installed via PIP](https://ytdl-sub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/install/agnostic.html#pip-install), but this required Python 3.10 or higher and ffmpeg to be already installed as dependancies.

## Usage

```shell
ytdl-sub --config config.yaml sub subscriptions.yaml
```
